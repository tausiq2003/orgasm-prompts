// The only test I know that image generation sucks is text generation, it can't generate a text, now, I tested generating keyboard image it failed, I might be stupid but it is what its.

## Prompt

Generate an image of a mechanical gaming 100% QWERTY keyboard with rgb lights on, that has fn keys, num pad in addition, that makes a 100% keyboard, the keys texture and the text written on it should be super clear and real, so that it feels natural not AI generated.
The image of the keyboard should be generated from the top angle such that it seems to be someone just clicked a pic from camera perpendicular to the keyboard. The environment around it should be real. The keys should be black, with the RGB on.
The text on the keys should be super real and extremely clear, so that it seems in HD. The text colour might be transparent because it should generate the rgb light running inside the circuit. The keys on keyboard should be QwERTY based, with all symbols, numbers,
alphabets and all the labels generated very clearly that seems like a real world keyboard. Imagine you are the proffessional photographer that gave this keyboard image in Ultra HD. Be real.
